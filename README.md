## Usage 

Upon loading any neopets page with a sidebar, it should initialize, and collect the data it needs for the first time, this takes a few seconds. When it's ready, it will display your pets. It will store this information locally so it doesn't have to reload every time, but will refresh every 12 hours. You can also refresh manually by clicking Update Sidebar at the bottom. You can also click the gear to change how often it should refresh. When you change your pets clothes, they wont show in the sidebar until it is refreshed.
